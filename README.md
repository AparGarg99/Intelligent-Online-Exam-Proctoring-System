# OVERVIEW üìö
In this project, we have built an automatic online exam
proctoring system that provides improved authentication and
abnormal behavior monitoring of examinees in the online examination based on image information. We have used image processing and deep learning to build the system.

Refer to the [Report](https://github.com/AparGarg99/Intelligent-Online-Exam-Proctoring-System/blob/master/Documentation/ITSS_Project_Report.pdf) for more details.

# NEW FUNCTIONALITIES üê£

* Instead of maintaining a database of student face images, face verification can be performed directly with the photo in the ID Card issued to the student. [Reference](https://github.com/mesutpiskin/id-card-detector)

# FUTURE WORK
* Lip reading
* Accurate eye tracking/gaze estimation.
* Accurate face spoofing detection.
* Detect nano-sized, non-wired devices such as Bluetooth earpieces,Spy eyewear, invisible smartwatch.
* Speaker verification [Ref1](https://github.com/Atul-Anand-Jha/Speaker-Identification-Python) | [Ref2](https://github.com/resemble-ai/Resemblyzer)
