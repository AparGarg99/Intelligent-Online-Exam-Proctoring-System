# OVERVIEW üìö
In this project, we have built an automatic online exam
proctoring system that provides improved authentication and
abnormal behavior monitoring of examinees in the online examination based on image information. We have used image processing and deep learning to build the system.

Refer to the [Report](https://github.com/AparGarg99/Intelligent-Online-Exam-Proctoring-System/blob/master/Documentation/ITSS_Project_Report.pdf) for more details.
